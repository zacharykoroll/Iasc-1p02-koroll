<p> <strong><em>I'm Mahe,an athlete in the sport of Rowing and 2012 Olympic Champion in the single scull.
  I have trained full time since 2001 and can honestly say I love my job. There are always tough times and
  things you hate doing,but overall it's a pretty awesome existence.
</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>
  <em>I have proudly represented New Zealand at nine World Championships and three Olympic Games. 2003 and 2004 I raced in the coxless four before switching to the single scull. Since switching to the single I have won five World Championship titles (2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011), two World Championship Silver (2010, 2014), Olympic Bronze (2008) and became the Olympic Champion in London 2012.</em>
