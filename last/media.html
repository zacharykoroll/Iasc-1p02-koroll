      Walinga, 48, was an integral part of the Canadian crew which won the 1991 world championship
      and set a world record while going undefeated in 24 consecutive races including the Olympics.
      She and her crew – including Kirsten Barnes, Brenda Taylor, Jessica Monroe-Gonin and alternate Kay
      Worthington – were destroying the field. They'd come a long way since a disappointing seventh in Seoul, South Korea in the
      1988 Olympics. Walinga was in the integral stroke seat where she set the rhythm while also steering with her feet.

      He made his senior world championship debut a year later in the lightweight
      pair. He just missed the world championship podium a year later with his
      fourth place finish in the lightweight pair with Brendan Hodge. Recently
      racing with the lightweight four, Woelfl and crew cracked the top-10 in two World
       Cup events in 2014. In 2015, he and the lightweight four, dubbed the “northern lights”,
       won gold at the Pan Am Games in Toronto, where the rowing events took place in his hometown of St. Catharines,
        giving him an amazing experience. They also secured an Olympic berth for Rio 2016 with their 11th place finish at the world championships

      Tim Schrijver made his move to the senior national team in 2015 after racing in two World U23 Championships, highlighted by a gold medal in the coxed
       four in 2014. With the coxless four, dubbed the “True North Four”, he won bronze at the 2015 World Cup stop in Varese, Italy and then narrowly missed
       the world championship podium with their fourth place finish. In between those two events, he won two gold medals at the 2015 Pan Am Games in Toronto as a
        member of the four and the eight. Collegiately, he was a dominant force for Brock University. In four seasons racing for the Badgers he went to the Canadian
        University Rowing Championships every year, finishing second in the eight in 2014, second in the eight in 2013 and 2012, and first in the pair in 2012. He also represented
        Canada at the 2014 University Rowing Championships, winning a silver medal in the coxless four. Following a back issue in 2013, Schrijver has had to overcome numerous injuries to his knees,
        elbows and ribs since 2014. That has forced him to come to terms with the need to balance quality training with injury maintenance. He didn’t compete at the second World Cup of 2016 to ensure
        he would be healthy for training in the lead-up to Rio 2016. In his Olympic debut, Schrijver and the four advanced to the A final, finishing sixth.
