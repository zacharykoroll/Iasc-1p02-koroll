<img src="shark1.jpg"  alt="hudson" class="shark">

<p class="para">Most of Brock's crew boat fleet are composed of Hudson's not only because they are made in North America but because of their fast boats. In the wild, a SHARK is a marvel of evolution and one of nature's most successful, most enduring designs -- over thousands of years, it has evolved, refined, and adapted to its environment to become the world's most fearsome predator.
<br></br>
<br></br>
And it's from this magnificent creature that we draw our inspiration. After all, when you're chasing your personal best or your competition, what better mindset to emulate than a SHARK?
<br></br>
<br></br>
With our supperior design elements, construction, and features that makes a HUDSON unlike any other boat on the water and lets crews achieve the potential they deserve. </p>
